# detailed-single-cell
Simulate LFP of single cell with detailed morphology

First run <Rotate_morphology.ipynb> to generate a rotated morpholgy of a cell obtained from Allen Cell Type database, such that the apical dendrite is aligned with y-axis.

Then run <simulate_detailed_single_cell_position.ipynb> that uses BMTK to simulate LFP of the cell with specificed location and orientation.
